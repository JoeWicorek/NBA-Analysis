# NBA-Analysis
Welcome to the NBA Analysis Project, a data-driven exploration of professional basketball trends, strategies, and player performance over the last two decades. Using the NBA Stats API, this project integrates diverse datasets to answer key research questions about the relationship between individual achievements, team success, and the evolution of playstyle in the NBA.

üèÄ Project Highlights
Key Questions Addressed:

How do individual player performance metrics (e.g., points, assists, rebounds) correlate with team success?
What are the trends in player physical attributes (e.g., height, weight, age) over the years, and how do they impact performance?
How has team playstyle (e.g., pace of play, three-point shooting) evolved, and which styles correlate with championships?
Comprehensive Data Analysis:

Merged player stats, player bio, and team data to create a unified dataset.
Conducted correlation and regression analyses to uncover key relationships.
Explored trends in player attributes and team strategies through data visualization.
Statistical Insights:

Weak but notable correlations between player scoring and team playoff success.
Height and weight impact rebounding, while agility benefits scoring and assists.
Three-point shooting and pace of play have increased, signaling a strategic shift in the modern NBA.
Data Visualizations:

Dynamic charts and graphs illustrate trends, such as player evolution and team strategies.
Comparative analysis of conference leaders versus league averages over time.

üìä Technologies and Tools
Languages: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: pandas
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Statistical Analysis: statsmodels
APIs: NBA Stats API (requests library for fetching data)

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Data Collection:

Fetch data using NBA Stats API for player performance, physical attributes, and team metrics.
Save datasets as CSV files for easy manipulation.
Data Cleaning and Merging:

Preprocess data to handle missing values and normalize metrics for consistency.
Merge datasets using common identifiers (e.g., player names, team IDs).
Analysis and Visualization:

Explore statistical correlations and trends.
Use visualizations to reveal actionable insights for analysts and enthusiasts.
Results:

Highlighted the interplay between individual performance and team success.
Identified key trends in playstyles that lead to championships.

üîç Challenges and Limitations
Time Constraints: Limited time for advanced testing and deeper analysis.
Correlation Complexity: While notable trends exist, the analysis suggests that success is influenced by many interrelated factors beyond those analyzed.
API Dependency: Results rely on the accuracy and consistency of the NBA Stats API data.
